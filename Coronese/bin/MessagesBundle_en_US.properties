welcome = Welcome to the SARS-CoV-2 Simulator!
intro1 = The 2019\u201320 coronavirus outbreak is an ongoing global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).  More than 115 countries and territories have been affected (March 2020), with major outbreaks in central China, Italy, South Korea and Iran. Public health responses around the world have included travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, and school closures. The whole italian peninsula has been declared as a "Red Zone" on the 09th of March 2020 by the PM Giuseppe Conte.
intro2 = With this simulation I try to illustrate the effect of staying at home can make. You can change all the variables on the next page to influence the course of the virus. (hint: lower the "Likelihood of leaving the house" and you can see the infectionrate dropping). People are divided into communities. That means, that an infected person can only transmit the virus to someone, who is in the same community (but watch out, as mentioned earlier they change). It takes an average of 5 days to recognize that you are ill. After that time the person will automatically stay at home. Those who recovered are less likely to be infected again. (It could happen, that the virus kills itself. In that case you have to press the button restart). The default values \u200B\u200Bare the current ones in Italy. This program is just a project that I did at home. If you see any mistakes or ideas for improvement, please don't hesitate to contact me. 
intro3 = Thank you for trying the program
